Niche Research [00:57-05:53]

Finding the Perfect Niche for a Directory Website
The presenter begins by exploring potential niches for their directory website, initially trying Boomerang Tasks but quickly switching to Cline with Anthropic's model when the first tool doesn't produce satisfactory results. They enable 'extended thinking' mode to get more comprehensive responses. When prompted, they specify that they're interested in creating a directory related to Ireland. After receiving several niche suggestions from the AI, the presenter begins evaluating them by examining the search engine results pages (SERPs) for related keywords. They analyze existing websites in these niches, looking at their design, traffic, and domain authority. The presenter shows particular interest in a website about Irish heritage sites, noting its outdated design despite receiving significant traffic (around 22,000 visitors). They observe that the site appears to be built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript rather than a content management system, suggesting that simpler technologies might actually be advantageous for AI-generated websites.

Some outdated websites still receive significant traffic, indicating opportunity
Niche Selection [05:54-11:20]

Evaluating and Selecting the Irish Beaches Directory Niche
After reviewing several options, the presenter narrows down their focus to Irish beaches and wild swimming locations. They examine the search volume for related keywords using AHREFS Keyword Explorer, noting that terms like 'Irish beaches' get around 800 searches per month. The presenter acknowledges that while the search volume isn't extremely high, it represents a viable niche with reasonable competition levels. The presenter emphasizes that newcomers shouldn't be discouraged when they see existing websites in their chosen niche. They point out that many existing websites have poor SEO implementation, outdated designs, or missing features that create opportunities for improvement. For example, they discover a wild swimming website that only has a map feature without individual pages for each location - a clear opportunity for creating a more comprehensive directory with dedicated pages for each swimming spot. The presenter decides to proceed with creating an Irish beaches and wild swimming directory, confident that they can create something better than what currently exists.

Key Takeaways:
The presenter selects Irish beaches and wild swimming locations as their niche
Keywords like 'Irish beaches' have moderate search volume (around 800 searches/month)
Don't be discouraged by existing websites in your chosen niche
Look for opportunities to improve upon existing websites (better design, more features)
Existing sites often lack individual pages for each location - a key opportunity
Competition analysis should focus on identifying gaps rather than being intimidated
Data Collection [11:21-18:00]

Gathering and Organizing Beach Data for the Directory
The presenter begins collecting data for their Irish beaches directory by finding lists of beaches online. They compile information from multiple sources into a spreadsheet, focusing on beaches with available information. The presenter acknowledges that they can always update the CSV file later with additional beaches as they find more data. Moving to the research phase, they use Cline with a universal prompt template that they've developed for this purpose. The presenter customizes the prompt to gather specific information about each beach, including logos, images, ratings, key features, and potential tags. They explain that these tags will be crucial for SEO purposes, as they'll create dedicated tag pages that can rank for specific keywords. The presenter demonstrates how they can identify valuable keywords using AHREFS, showing that terms like 'Ring of Kerry' have significant search volume (53,000 worldwide, 15,000 in the US). They explain how incorporating these high-volume keywords as tags can help capture additional search traffic.

Key Takeaways:
Compile beach data from multiple online sources into a spreadsheet
Use AI tools like Cline to research detailed information about each location
Collect data points like ratings, key features, and potential tags for each beach
Tags serve dual purposes: organization and SEO opportunity
Research high-volume keywords related to your locations (e.g., 'Ring of Kerry')
Plan to create dedicated tag pages that can rank for these valuable keywords
The research can be expanded over time as you add more locations
Advanced SEO Strategy [18:01-23:59]

Implementing Question-Based SEO for Higher Rankings
The presenter demonstrates an advanced SEO strategy by showing how to incorporate frequently asked questions into their directory website. They explain that for each tag page (like 'Ring of Kerry beaches'), they can identify common questions that users ask about that topic by examining the 'People Also Ask' section in Google search results. By answering these questions on their tag pages, they can capture additional search traffic and provide more value to users. To implement this strategy, the presenter modifies their research prompt to include a request for questions related to each tag. They instruct the AI to search for terms like 'Ring of Kerry' on Google and extract questions from the 'People Also Ask' section. Although they encounter some issues with the AI's ability to access this information directly, they still manage to collect relevant questions like 'Can you drive the Ring of Kerry in one day?' and 'How long does the Ring of Kerry take?' The presenter explains that incorporating answers to these questions on their tag pages will help them rank for long-tail keywords and provide comprehensive information that users are actively seeking.

Key Takeaways:
Identify common questions users ask about your topics using 'People Also Ask' in Google
Include answers to these questions on your tag pages to capture long-tail keywords
This strategy helps target specific search queries that users are actively asking
Questions like 'Can you drive the Ring of Kerry in one day?' represent valuable SEO opportunities
Comprehensive content that answers user questions ranks better in search results
AI tools can help identify and extract these questions from search results
This approach provides both SEO benefits and genuine value to users
Website Development Setup [24:00-29:59]

Setting Up Augment Code for WordPress Development
The presenter transitions to the website development phase, explaining that they'll be using Augment Code to create the WordPress directory. They mention that they're using Augment because it's currently free, though they note that if it becomes expensive in the future, alternatives like R Code would be preferable. The presenter opens a fresh WordPress installation in Local WordPress and accesses the installation folder through VS Code. Before starting the development process, the presenter prepares the environment by copying their beach data into the workspace and indexing the codebase. They switch to 'agent auto' mode in Augment Code and prepare their prompt for the AI. The presenter customizes a template prompt, instructing the AI to refactor code and use components to create shorter files that don't overuse context length. This approach helps prevent issues with the AI's context limitations and creates more maintainable code. With the environment set up and the prompt ready, they submit it to Augment Code to begin the website creation process.

Key Takeaways:
Augment Code is used for WordPress development (currently free)
The presenter uses Local WordPress for local development environment
VS Code provides access to the WordPress installation folder
Beach data is copied into the workspace before development begins

Parallel Processing [30:00-35:59]

Simultaneous Research and Development with Multiple AI Tools
The presenter discovers a breakthrough in their workflow: they can simultaneously research new beaches with Cline while Augment Code builds the website. This parallel processing capability wasn't previously possible when using tools based on the same underlying system. The presenter is visibly excited about this discovery, explaining that it dramatically increases productivity by allowing data collection and website development to happen concurrently. This parallel workflow means that as Cline researches each new beach, it adds data that will eventually become multiple pages on the website - including county pages, tag pages, and individual beach pages. The presenter estimates that each beach researched could generate 15 or more pages on the final website. They outline their ideal AI workflow: using Cline or R Code for niche research, Augment Code for the first draft of the website, and then R Code or Cline for bug fixing. The presenter emphasizes that this combination of tools, leveraging Multiple Context Providers (MCPs) for autonomous internet searches, represents a game-changing approach to website creation.

Key Takeaways:
Cline and Augment Code can run simultaneously for parallel processing
Research and development can happen concurrently, dramatically increasing efficiency
Each beach researched generates multiple pages (county, tags, individual beach)
The ideal workflow combines different AI tools for specific tasks
Cline/R Code for research, Augment Code for development, R Code/Cline for bug fixing
Multiple Context Providers (MCPs) enable autonomous internet searches
This parallel workflow wasn't possible with previous tools based on the same system
The presenter estimates this approach could generate 10-15 pages per beach researched
Monetization Strategy [36:00-37:59]

The Financial Potential of AI-Generated Directories
The presenter outlines the financial opportunity of creating AI-generated directory websites at scale. They predict that Google's current search paradigm may face significant challenges within the next five years, creating a window of opportunity for website creators. During this period, they suggest that display ads on these directory websites could generate substantial income. The presenter calculates that if a website accumulates 10 million views over five years (approximately 2 million views per year), it could generate around $150,000 in ad revenue, or about $30,000 extra income per year. The key to capitalizing on this opportunity, according to the presenter, is to rapidly create multiple directory websites across various niches. They encourage viewers to not only follow their demonstrated process but to further automate and scale it. While acknowledging that SEO is facing challenges, the presenter maintains that there's still significant money to be made in this space for those who can efficiently create valuable content at scale using AI tools.
