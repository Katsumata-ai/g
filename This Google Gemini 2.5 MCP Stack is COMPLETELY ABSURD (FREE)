Search Operators Explained [00:28]

Leveraging Search Operators for Competitive Intelligence
The presenter demonstrates how search operators can be used for competitive intelligence by showing examples of how to find trending keywords on specific websites. Using the site: operator with Redbubble.com as an example, he shows how to filter results by time periods (past 24 hours, week, month, or year) to see what content has recently been indexed by Google. This technique allows users to monitor competitors' content strategies and identify potential keyword opportunities. Building on this foundation, the presenter showcases more advanced search operator combinations. He demonstrates how to use operators like 'intext:' and 'inurl:' to find specific types of pages, such as guest posting opportunities in the men's clothing niche. By combining these operators with relevant industry terms, users can discover highly specific pages that match their exact criteria, such as websites accepting guest posts in particular industries.

Key Takeaways:
Site: operator can be used to monitor what content is being indexed from specific websites
Time filters help identify recently published or indexed content
Combining operators (site:, intext:, inurl:) creates powerful search queries for specific purposes
These techniques can be used to spy on competitors' content strategies
Search operators can help find guest posting opportunities and backlink prospects
MCP Server Setup [02:56]

Setting Up the CLINE MCP Stack with Brave and Fetch APIs
The presenter transitions to showing how these search techniques can be implemented using a combination of CLINE, Brave API, and Fetch API in Visual Studio Code. He mentions testing with GPT-4 Mini but notes it doesn't work as effectively as Google's Gemini model, though he's seeking backup options for when Google inevitably starts charging more for their API. The presenter shows his current MCP server setup, which includes Fetch, Stripe, Perplexity, and Brave integrations. For viewers unfamiliar with MCP servers, the presenter references his comprehensive course available through a link in the video description.

Practical Demonstration [05:16]

Real-Time Example of Brave MCP for Keyword Research
The presenter provides a live demonstration of using the Brave MCP stack to perform keyword research for Redbubble, a print-on-demand platform. He crafts a prompt instructing the system to use search operators to find Redbubble t-shirt keywords that have started ranking in Google within the past week. The system successfully executes the search and returns results showing trending t-shirt designs, demonstrating how this technique can identify emerging market opportunities in the print-on-demand space. While reviewing the results, the presenter notes that the inclusion of images in the response is unnecessary for his purposes. He explores one of the returned results, explaining that these items appearing in Google search results indicates they're ranking, though not necessarily receiving high search volume. This practical example showcases how the system can be applied to real-world market research and trend identification in e-commerce niches.

Key Takeaways:
Live demonstration shows how to use Brave MCP to find trending Redbubble t-shirt keywords
The system successfully identifies items recently indexed by Google
Results can help identify emerging market opportunities for print-on-demand businesses
The presenter notes that image inclusion in results is unnecessary and could be optimized
Appearing in Google results indicates ranking but doesn't necessarily guarantee high search volume
Backlink Prospecting [07:01]

Automated Guest Post Opportunity Discovery
The presenter continues with another practical example, this time focusing on finding guest posting opportunities for backlink building. Using the same MCP stack with a different prompt, he demonstrates how the system can automatically discover websites accepting guest posts in specific niches. The Brave API efficiently executes the search and returns a comprehensive list of potential backlink opportunities, with the Fetch API then scraping additional details from each page to provide more context about the opportunities. What makes this demonstration particularly impressive is that the entire process is completely free. The presenter notes that the Brave API provides 2,000 requests per month at no cost, and he has only used 39 requests despite testing the system for a couple of days. This abundance of free requests makes the solution sustainable for regular use in SEO and backlink building campaigns without incurring any expenses.

Key Takeaways:
The system can automatically find guest posting opportunities for backlink building
Brave API executes the search while Fetch API scrapes additional page details
The process is completely free with Brave API offering 2,000 monthly requests at no cost

The fetch:text option is recommended for faster and more efficient text extraction
Automation Potential [08:15]

Building Complete SEO Automation Systems
The presenter explains how this technology can be extended into a complete automation system for SEO and backlink building. By exporting the discovered opportunities to Google Sheets and connecting with automation tools like Zapier or Make (formerly Integromat), users can create an end-to-end workflow that continuously discovers and processes backlink opportunities. He suggests implementing systems to prevent duplicates, either through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or by feeding the current CSV back into the system with instructions to avoid duplicating URLs. Beyond backlink building, the presenter highlights the versatility of the data collected. The information can be transformed into PDFs, reports, or other formats that can be sold as products, used for client work, or leveraged in various business contexts.
