Research Phase [01:15]

Using Roo Code to Gather Business Information
The research phase begins with Roo Code, which the presenter shows has been running overnight on a previous project researching beaches in Ireland. This demonstrates how the tool can automatically compile comprehensive information with minimal input. For the plumber example, the presenter creates a prompt instructing Roo Code to gather as much information as possible about "Palms Plumbing in Athenry" and output it as a JSON file. The system leverages multiple Machine Cognition Processors (MCPs) including Google Maps, Brave Search, and Fetch to gather business details. It collects the business address, contact information, opening hours, reviews, services offered, and even images from Google My Business. Additionally, the presenter discovers a method to incorporate stock images from Unsplash to supplement the business's actual photos, creating a more visually appealing website.

Key Takeaways:
Roo Code can run automated research tasks that collect comprehensive business information
The system uses Google Maps MCP to extract business details from Google My Business listings
Brave Search and Fetch MCPs gather additional third-party information about the business
The tool automatically collects reviews, services, contact information, and business images
Stock images from Unsplash can be incorporated to enhance the visual appeal
All information is structured into a JSON file for easy use in the website building phase
The entire research process is extremely cost-effective, with many components being free
Service Information [10:00]

Extracting Detailed Service Information
A critical component of creating an effective lead generation website is accurately representing the business's services. The presenter demonstrates how to extract detailed service information using the Browser Use MCP, which can navigate to Google, search for the business, and extract service listings from their Google My Business profile. This provides the foundation for creating service-specific landing pages. The process involves setting up a browser agent with sufficient timeout settings to allow for comprehensive data extraction. The presenter shows how to follow along with the agent's progress through a live link, ensuring it correctly navigates to the business listing and extracts all available service information. This automated approach eliminates the need for manual copying and allows for the creation of a repeatable standard operating procedure (SOP) that can be applied to any business.

Key Takeaways:
Service information is crucial for creating targeted landing pages
The Browser Use MCP can navigate Google and extract service listings automatically
Setting appropriate timeout values is important for successful data extraction
The process can be monitored in real-time through a live link
This approach creates a repeatable SOP for gathering business service information
The extracted service information enables creation of location-specific service pages
This automated approach is significantly faster than manual research methods
Website Creation [14:30]

Setting Up Local WordPress and Augment Code
With the research phase complete and a comprehensive JSON file containing all necessary business information, the presenter moves to the website creation phase. This begins with creating a new site in Local WordPress, naming it after the business (Palms Plumbing). The presenter emphasizes the importance of having VS Code installed with the option to open files directly from right-click context menus. Augment Code is then used to index the codebase, preparing it to generate the website. The presenter crafts a detailed prompt instructing Augment Code to use the JSON file to build a complete website for the plumber. The prompt specifies that every object in the JSON should be used at least once, images should be incorporated throughout, call-to-action elements should be included to generate leads, and service pages should be created for all major cities in the service area. Additional instructions include creating a modern design with modular vertical blocks, a mega menu header, and a comprehensive footer.

Key Takeaways:
Local WordPress provides the foundation for the website with built-in database functionality
VS Code integration is essential for working with Augment Code
Augment Code can generate websites from structured JSON data
The prompt must specify design elements, page structure, and functionality requirements
The system can create location-specific service pages automatically
The process allows for simultaneous work on multiple websites
WordPress's built-in database simplifies the implementation of contact forms
Elementor Approach [20:30]

Testing Elementor for Website Building
The presenter explores using Elementor with Augment Code as an alternative approach to website creation. Augment Code generates commands to install necessary plugins including Elementor, WordPress SEO (Yoast), and WP Forms. It then proceeds to create template files for the homepage and other key pages, which can be imported into Elementor. However, after testing this approach, the presenter concludes that while Elementor integration works, it's not the optimal solution. The process requires more manual steps to import templates, and some features require the paid Pro version of Elementor. The presenter decides that a custom theme approach would be more efficient and proceeds to restart the process without Elementor, focusing on a vanilla WordPress implementation instead.

Key Takeaways:
Augment Code can generate Elementor templates and install necessary plugins
The Elementor approach requires manual importing of template files
Some desired features require Elementor Pro (paid version)
The Elementor approach produces visually appealing results but with limitations
A custom theme approach is generally more efficient for this use case
The experiment confirms Augment Code's flexibility with different WordPress approaches
Custom Theme Approach [28:00]

Building a Custom WordPress Theme
After deciding against the Elementor approach, the presenter restarts the process to create a custom WordPress theme. Using the same JSON data, a new prompt is crafted specifically requesting not to use Elementor. Augment Code then proceeds to create a custom theme built on WordPress 2024/2025, which the presenter believes will be faster and more efficient. The system automatically creates custom CSS, determines major towns within the service area, and builds a comprehensive site structure. The presenter activates the generated theme through the WordPress admin panel, revealing a professional-looking website with modern design elements. While some pages initially show as "not found," the presenter demonstrates how to publish the generated pages and create the navigation menus to complete the site structure.

Key Takeaways:
Custom themes built on WordPress 2024/2025 offer better performance than Elementor
Augment Code can automatically create custom CSS and theme files
The system can determine service areas based on geographic proximity
The generated theme includes professional design elements without requiring paid plugins
Some manual publishing of pages is required to complete the site structure
The custom theme approach produces cleaner code and faster loading times
WordPress navigation menus can be automatically generated
